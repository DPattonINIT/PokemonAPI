 Pokemon API

 // Brief Description of what you did. 
  I created a Pokémon search and favorite system where users can search for Pokémon by name or ID, with a restriction on pokemon past generation 5 . Users can add their favorite Pokémon to a list, view details like abilities and evolution, and manage favorites stored in the browser's local storage.

- [] what i can recommend: one thing i will say when i opened it up is that your pulling my older local data from other project
  ### whats showing 
  - robert

what you can do to fix it rename the keys/ the list or what your saving it to

- [] white space at the bottom desktop/ tablet
- [] enter do's not work when i press it to load the Pokemon in search bar

### other than that it looks good
