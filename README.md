 Pokemon API

 // Brief Description of what you did. 
  I created a Pokémon search and favorite system where users can search for Pokémon by name or ID, with a restriction on pokemon past generation 5 . Users can add their favorite Pokémon to a list, view details like abilities and evolution, and manage favorites stored in the browser's local storage.
